# Supabase Edge Functions Integration - Complete

## üéâ Phase 3 Successfully Completed!

We have successfully integrated the advanced web scraping functionality from the `opportunity-fetcher` project into our main application using Supabase Edge Functions. Here's what we've accomplished:

## ‚úÖ What's Been Deployed

### 1. **Edge Functions Deployed to Supabase**

Three powerful Edge Functions are now live and running:

- **`fetch-post-content`** - Intelligent content extraction with WordPress/CMS heuristics
- **`discover-posts`** - Multi-strategy post discovery (RSS, Sitemap, Seed-based)
- **`scheduled-scraper`** - Automated scraping orchestration

### 2. **Enhanced Application Architecture**

```
Frontend Components ‚Üí Next.js API Routes ‚Üí Supabase Edge Functions ‚Üí Database
```

- **Frontend**: Enhanced scraping dashboard with real-time stats
- **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints for scraping operations
- **Edge Functions**: Server-side processing for complex scraping operations
- **Database**: Comprehensive schema for advanced scraping data

### 3. **New Service Layer**

Created `lib/services/scraping-service-v2.ts` with methods for:
- **Source Management**: Create, read, update, delete scraping sources
- **Schedule Configuration**: Automated scraping schedules
- **Advanced Operations**: Post discovery, content extraction, full scraping runs
- **Analytics**: Real-time stats and performance metrics

## üöÄ Key Features Now Available

### **Intelligent Post Discovery**
- **Auto-detection**: Automatically chooses best strategy (RSS, Sitemap, or Seed)
- **Multi-fallback**: Tries multiple methods for maximum coverage
- **Smart Scoring**: Advanced URL scoring for better post identification
- **Validation**: Content validation to ensure quality posts

### **Advanced Content Extraction**
- **WordPress Optimized**: Specialized extraction for WordPress sites
- **Multi-CMS Support**: Works with various content management systems
- **Clean HTML**: Removes scripts, styles, and unsafe elements
- **Metadata Extraction**: Pulls title, author, publish date, and tags
- **Relative URL Resolution**: Fixes images and links automatically

### **Automated Scheduling**
- **Cron-based**: Flexible scheduling with cron expressions
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Avoids re-scraping existing content
- **Batch Processing**: Handles multiple sources efficiently
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure recovery and reporting

## üìä New API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/scraping` | GET/POST | Manage scraping sources |
| `/api/scraping/[id]` | PUT/DELETE | Update/delete specific sources |
| `/api/scraping/test-source` | POST | Test source functionality |
| `/api/scraping/schedule-v2` | GET/PUT | Schedule configuration |
| `/api/scraping/run` | POST | Manual scraper execution |
| `/api/scraping/stats` | GET | Real-time statistics |

## üéØ Enhanced Dashboard

Access the enhanced scraping dashboard at:
- **Admin**: `http://localhost:3000/admin/scraping`
- **Test Page**: `http://localhost:3000/test-edge-functions`

### Dashboard Features:
- **Real-time Stats**: Live metrics and performance data
- **Source Management**: Add, edit, and test scraping sources
- **Schedule Configuration**: Set up automated scraping schedules
- **Progress Monitoring**: Track scraping operations in real-time
- **Enhanced Indicators**: Visual feedback for advanced features

## üîß How to Use

### 1. **Add a New Source**
```typescript
// Via the dashboard or API
const source = await ScrapingService.createSource({
  name: 'Example Site',
  url: 'https://example.com',
  max_posts: 10,
  source_type: 'website',
  is_active: true
});
```

### 2. **Test Source Discovery**
```typescript
// Test post discovery
const result = await ScrapingService.testSource('https://example.com');
console.log(`Found ${result.discoveredPosts} posts`);
```

### 3. **Run Manual Scraping**
```typescript
// Execute full scraping run
const result = await ScrapingService.runScheduledScraper();
console.log(`Found ${result.totalOpportunities} new opportunities`);
```

### 4. **Configure Scheduling**
```typescript
// Set up automated scraping
await ScrapingService.updateScheduleConfig({
  cron_expression: '0 */6 * * *', // Every 6 hours
  is_enabled: true
});
```

## üìà Performance Benefits

- **Edge Function Processing**: Server-side execution for heavy operations
- **Intelligent Caching**: Avoids duplicate processing
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient handling of multiple sources
- **Error Resilience**: Continues processing even if individual sources fail
- **Resource Optimization**: Minimal client-side processing

## üîç Testing Instructions

1. **Visit Test Page**: Go to `http://localhost:3000/test-edge-functions`
2. **Test Discovery**: Enter a URL and test post discovery
3. **Test Content**: Extract content from discovered posts
4. **Run Full Scraper**: Execute complete scraping operation
5. **Check Results**: View scraped data in admin dashboard

## üéä Integration Complete!

Your application now has the full advanced scraping capabilities from the `opportunity-fetcher` project, enhanced with:

- Supabase Edge Functions for scalable server-side processing
- Comprehensive database schema for advanced scraping data
- Enhanced UI with real-time statistics and monitoring
- RESTful API for programmatic access
- Automated scheduling and error handling

The integration preserves all existing functionality while adding powerful new scraping capabilities that can discover and extract opportunities from virtually any website automatically.

## Next Steps

You can now:
1. Add your preferred opportunity websites as scraping sources
2. Configure automated schedules to run regularly
3. Monitor performance through the enhanced dashboard
4. Extend the system with additional custom extraction rules
5. Integrate the scraped opportunities into your main opportunity feed

**The advanced web scraping system is now fully operational! üöÄ**
